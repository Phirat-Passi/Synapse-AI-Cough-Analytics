# Synapse AI - Cough Recording Analyzer

At Synapse, we developed a Cough- audio monitory application system to collect audio data streams in a continuous manner via Smartphone embedded microphone sensor processed with a set of AI algorithms, analyzing and compiling from a compound set of Institutional & Open-source datasets. This Cough Analyzer assesses forced cough recordings using internal audio microphone sensor to evaluate an illness on the basis of cough identification, classification following a mathematical model eliminating the additional sound layers (by Feature Extraction method) allowing cough sounds to be reconstructed from the feature set, along with preventing speech from being reconstructed and degenerated intelligibly. This application reliably collects sound data and uploads them securely to a remote server for subsequent analysis, increasing the accuracy of our model.
